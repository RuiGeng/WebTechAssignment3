Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, build the game of "Concentration".  
You may build with a standard deck of cards, or any of the variations - but ensure that you layout at least 10 cards on the screen.

Requirements:

- Responsive Design (You may use Bootstrap for styles ONLY - no js)
- Properly implement the game in an object oriented way using concepts discussed in class.
- Proper use of JS classes / functions (you may use libraries such as jQuery, but please NO GAME LIBRARIES)
- Have some sort of scoring system (timer / matches)
- Have a way to start a new game when completed (so need a way to catch when a game is complete!)
- Leave cards flipped over when they match.
